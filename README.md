# Simple MATLAB to WebAssembly Example

This is a practice mini-project for myself to WebAssembly. See https://github.com/minoue-xx/rebalance_portfolio for another example.

Here MATLAB's fmincon (Optimization Toolbox) is implemented as a form of WebAssembly, through "Generate JavaScript Using MATLAB Coder" version 2.0.2 by Geoff McVittie. The tool allows you to create JavaScript/WebAssembly libraries from MATLAB projects using MATLAB Coder.

You can find the tool here: https://jp.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69973-generate-javascript-using-matlab-coder
